                     We are the Oxford Drunken Knitwits, and we are knit-aholics.
                     Sip by sip and stitch by stitch, we continue to pursue drunken,
                     hand-cramping knit-thood, whereby all Knitwits have the holy grail of drunken knitting to show off to our friends: a hand-crafted item whose place,
                     time, and method of construction cannot entirely be recalled.
                     If you want to follow us on our path, we can show you the way...

                           Most of our members will agree that the Drunken Knitwits are hands-down the best knitting clubs in existence today, and probably ever.
                           The first chapter was established in Oxford, UK in 2012 to fill a desperate need for old-fashioned drunken knitting get-togethers.
                           Break-out chapters have been popping up ever since and now we're in @continents.Count continents, @countries.Count countries, and @chapters.Count cities.
                           There's no looking back! Whether you're a knitter who needs to add a social aspect to your hobby, someone who's always wanted to learn to knit,
                           or someone who's new to town and wants to take on a new hobby while making friends, then the Drunken Knitwits are the people you’ve been looking for.
