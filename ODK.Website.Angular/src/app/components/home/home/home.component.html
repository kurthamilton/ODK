            We are the Oxford Drunken Knitwits, and we are knit-aholics. 
            Sip by sip and stitch by stitch, we continue to pursue drunken, 
            hand-cramping knit-thood, whereby all Knitwits have the holy grail of drunken knitting to show off to our friends: a hand-crafted item whose place, 
            time, and method of construction cannot entirely be recalled. 
            If you want to follow us on our path, we can show you the way...

        <p>As the Romans used to say...</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">"Veniimus, bibimus, knitimus"</p>
        <p>("We came, we drank, we knit")</p>

            Most of our members will agree that the Drunken Knitwits are hands-down the best knitting clubs in existence today, and probably ever. 
            The first chapter was established in Oxford, UK in 2012 to fill a desperate need for old-fashioned drunken knitting get-togethers. 
            Break-out chapters have been popping up ever since and now we're in 3 continents, 
            <span *ngIf="countries">{{countries.length}}</span> countries, and <span *ngIf="chapters">{{chapters.length}}</span> cities. 
            There's no looking back! Whether you're a knitter who needs to add a social aspect to your hobby, someone who's always wanted to learn to knit, 
            or someone who's new to town and wants to take on a new hobby while making friends, then the Drunken Knitwits are the people youâ€™ve been looking for.
